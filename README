This project can be used as a starting point for
implementation of the Invoice system. 

NOTE: This is a sample project structure created in Eclipse (hence
may not be compatible with other IDEs).

This is just an example. You are highly encouraged 
to be creative and design your own project structure (directories,files,package names
etc), as long as you are following the instructions mentioned in the assignment
handouts in each phase.

Follow the following instructions to import into Eclipse:
	1. Download this zip file (archive file) from Blackboard (to your desktop or Z: drive)
	2. Go to File-> Import-> General-> Existing Projects into Workspace
	3. Select “Select archive file” and select the zip file you downloaded
	4. Change build path settings as appropriate (to link to appropriate JDK
		or other libraries on your local system).

Here is a brief explanation of various sub-directories:

src (Included in build path) : Source packages.
design : Design documents, other images,UML diagrams etc.
data : Contains input/output data files.
lib : External libraries.
db : Keep your database DDL and DML scripts here.
bin (Not visible in eclipse) : Contains compiled classes and packages.
