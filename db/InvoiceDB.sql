/* Assignment 4 - (Phase III) -DDL statements
Author(s):
Date:
Instructions: 
  Include all the necessary SQL queries to create your database. 
  Make sure to:
	-Use conditional DROP TABLE IF EXISTS statements to clear out old versions of tables with the same name.
	-Do NOT include a “USE database” statement: we will be running your DDL on our own database instance and will not have access to your database.
	-After creating your tables, include all necessary insert statements (along with any nested select queries) to populate your database 
	with some test data (this should be the same data as in the test cases used in the previous phase if you wish).
